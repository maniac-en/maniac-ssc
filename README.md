ToDo:

- To fix

    - `generate_page` func where the last line of input is following:
        - maybe it even breaks when it's in top or anywhere else in file (?!?)
        > "Splendid! Then we have an accord: in the realm of fantasy and beyond, Tolkien's creation is unparalleled, a treasure trove of wisdom, wonder, and the indomitable spirit of adventure that dwells within us all."

    - `extract_title` func

    - mock test for `copy_static_to_public` func

- Pending docstrings and tests

- Updating README with details on what is this and how to use it, features not implemented by design, etc.
